It includes:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and consolidating childcare datasets.  
- **Data Analysis**: Understanding enrollment trends, provider types, and special educational needs (SEN).  
- **Pandemic Impact**: Examining regional and local authority-level changes due to COVID-19.  
- **Additional Funding**: Identifying support for disadvantaged children.  
- **Presentation**: Summarizing findings collaboratively in PowerPoint.

### 📈 Key Insights  

1. **Enrollment and Entitlements**:  
   - **15-hour funding** is universally available for 3- and 4-year-olds.  
   - As of April 2024, 15-hour funding is extended to **some 2-year-olds**.  

2. **Pandemic Impact**:  
   - Childcare registration dropped significantly in **2020**.  
   - Regional disparities showed a stronger decline in northern regions and certain local authorities.  

3. **Disadvantaged Children**:  
   - **Early Years Pupil Premium (EYPP)** funding supports disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds.  
   - Over **87% of disadvantaged cases** are linked to economic challenges, particularly in northern regions.  

4. **Special Educational Needs (SEN)**:  
   - SEN children often receive 15-hour entitlements, with fewer benefiting from 30-hour funding.  
   - Types of support include SEN programs and formal EHC plans for children with complex needs.
